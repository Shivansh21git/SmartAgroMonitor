# SmartAgroMonitor

SmartAgroMonitor is an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring of soil nutrients, pH levels, and moisture. This project integrates Modbus communication, an OLED display, and a GSM module to provide essential soil data for agricultural applications.

# Features
Monitors soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels.
Measures soil pH levels and moisture content.
Displays real-time sensor data on an OLED screen.
Sends SMS notifications with sensor readings via GSM module.


# Components
